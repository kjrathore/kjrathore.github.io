# Simulating Hurricane Risk to Price Insurance Losses

Insurers price hurricane risk using roughly 50 years of *reliable* storm data. That's not enough to know what a true 1-in-500-year storm looks like — and climate change is making the historical record even less useful. **Under-pricing that tail risk is how insurers go insolvent.**

I built a full probabilistic catastrophe model — the same class of system used by Verisk/AIR and Moody's RMS — that simulates **10,000 years** of physically plausible hurricanes against a synthetic **$39.01B** Gulf & Atlantic coast property portfolio, and prices the resulting insurance losses down to the dollar.

## By the Numbers

| | |
|---|---|
| 🌀 **10,000-year** stochastic storm catalog | built from 170 years of NOAA HURDAT2 records |
| 🏠 **10,000 properties**, $39.01B insured value | synthesized from real NOAA county GDP data |
| 📊 **500M+** simulated event-property interactions | the core computational bottleneck |
| 💾 **50 MB** peak memory | down from a multi-GB out-of-memory crash |
| 📉 **1.5 GB → 120 MB** on disk | columnar Parquet + Snappy compression |

## Where the Risk Lives

*Insured loss accumulation across the coastal portfolio — bubble size is property value, color is simulated lifetime loss.*

## What It Costs to Survive the Tail

![Exceedance Probability Curve](images/exceedance_probability_curve.png)
*The capital question every insurer has to answer: how much do I need on the balance sheet to survive a 1-in-100 or 1-in-500 year storm?*

| Return Period | Insured Loss |
|---|---|
| 1-in-10 years | $124,967 |
| 1-in-50 years | $138.3M |
| 1-in-100 years (solvency benchmark) | $381.7M |
| 1-in-500 years (ruin boundary) | $1.87B |

## Who Pays, By Construction Type

## How It Works

Four linked stages — the standard architecture across the cat-modeling industry:

1. **Hazard** — Fit a continuous Weibull distribution to historical storm intensities (MLE), then simulate thousands of years of new storms, including Category 5 events the historical record has never directly observed.
2. **Exposure** — Use NOAA economic indices to realistically place a synthetic property portfolio across six high-hazard coastal counties (Miami-Dade, Harris, Charleston, and others).
3. **Vulnerability** — Convert each property's local wind speed into a physical damage percentage via log-normal fragility curves, by construction class.
4. **Financial** — Apply real insurance contract terms — deductibles, policy limits — to convert physical damage into what an insurer actually pays out, then aggregate into Average Annual Loss (AAL) and Tail VaR.

## The Engineering Problem Nobody Talks About

A 10,000-year catalog against a multi-thousand-property portfolio produces **500+ million** event-asset interaction rows. Every naive pandas pipeline I tried died the same way:

```
numpy._core._exceptions._ArrayMemoryError: Unable to allocate 3.73 GiB for an array
```

The fix was treating this as a data engineering problem, not a modeling one:

- **Streamed, never loaded.** PyArrow's `iter_batches()` processes the simulation in 5M-row chunks straight to disk — RAM stays flat under 50 MB regardless of dataset size.
- **Binary, not text.** Columnar Parquet + Snappy compression cut storage by 85%+ with zero precision loss.
- **Vectorized, not looped.** Replacing `iterrows()` with `np.where` / `np.maximum` pushed the math to compiled C-level array operations.
