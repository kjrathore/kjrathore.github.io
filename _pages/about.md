***"Life is like a [chaotic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory){:target="_blank"}, where you might need to find another basin of attractor to keep the system in equilibrium."***


I'm Kunal Rathore — an AI/ML engineer and PhD researcher at [Oregon State University](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/academics/degrees/artificial-intelligence), working at the intersection of [Environmental Sciences](https://gradschool.oregonstate.edu/environmental-sciences-graduate-program-esgp) and Applied AI. With hands-on industry experience building and deploying production ML systems at [Seagate Technology](https://www.seagate.com/) and [Persistent Systems](https://www.persistent.com/), I bring a strong track record of translating research into scalable, industry-ready solutions.

My work spans **Generative AI & LLMs**, **Scientific Machine Learning**, **Explainable AI**, **Computer Vision**, and **Data-driven Predictive Modeling** from enterprise NL-to-SQL pipelines and real-time sentiment platforms to digital twin models for environmental forecasting.

Currently, I research with Prof. James Watson at the [Socio-Environmental Analysis (SEA)](https://jrwatson.ceoas.oregonstate.edu/about/) Lab, developing hybrid AI models that combine mechanistic science with deep learning for ecosystem prediction and critical transition detection.

**Featured Projects — [View All →](/projects/)**

* **[NL2SQL: LLM-Powered Natural Language to Database Query Engine](/projects/nl2sql)** — Multi-stage prompt-engineered pipeline built at Seagate Technology that converts plain-English questions into optimized SQL queries at 91% accuracy, cutting query fulfillment from days to <3 seconds.
* **[Hybrid HAB: Digital Twins for Predicting Harmful Algal Blooms](/projects/hybrid_hab)** — Hybrid ML + mechanistic modeling framework for real-time bloom prediction and "what-if" scenario testing in lake ecosystems. Funded by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
* **[C-Star: Predicting Unresolved Variables in Dynamical Systems](/projects/c_star)** — Universal Dynamic Equations (UDEs) that uncover hidden drivers of ecosystem regime shifts from observable data alone — delivering superior early-warning capability with less data than conventional methods.
* **[GEPC: Making AI Decisions Understandable](/projects/gepc)** — Scalable Explainable AI framework achieving 84% label-transfer accuracy across 158 ImageNet categories, reducing annotation effort by 85%. Published at [IJCAI 2024 XAI Workshop](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.15393v1).

* If our interests match, I am always open to collaborating and starting something adventurous! Please feel free to connect.
