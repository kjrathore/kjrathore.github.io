I am writing this post to introduce how interesting is the world of ecology. Specifically I want to share my experiences with the "Fresh Water Ecology" course at OSU, which has shown me a completely different perspective of looking at nature. How? lets get into the details.

Basics & connect the new dots..
======
* Properties of water
  * Physical, chemical and biological
* Understanding temperature profiles in different seasons/ eutrophic states w.r.t water depth. ![Temperature profile](/images/DetroitLake_td.png)
* Lab and site experiments to understand the stratification in water and effect of wind, light and heat.
* Lake Morphometry
* Concentration and effects of nutrients like Nitrogen, Phosphorus.
* Aquatic Ecosystems in brief
* Population Dynamics etc..


A glimpse of what I did in classwork assignments.
------
1. Searched more about various types of Algae, classifications, their habitat and food web.

2. Read more about various types of Zooplantons in fresh water bodies.
