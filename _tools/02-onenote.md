I personally like and recommend people to use One Note.

For following reasons: 
======
* Flexibility to add any content: Table/sheets, article references with urls, quick access to font styles.
* Nice User Interface, ease of accessibility;
* Can create multiple notebooks that can be stored in onedrive with very less memory overheads.
* Arrange multiple "Chapter" in a notebook; specify multiple "Page Name/title" in under chapter.
* I generally try to keep it projectwise notebooks.
* Easy to keep my thoughts; experiments + experimental minor updates/twicks; results & observations with images  etc.

Being said I hope no one tries to hack in my OneNote!! :laughing:
