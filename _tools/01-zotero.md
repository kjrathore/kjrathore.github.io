I do like Zotero for for book keeping all my literatures!


Becoz:
======
* Can make projectwise collections, chapterwise subcollections.
* Can be online, I can access from any machine.
* Keep my readings handy; save highlighted PDF documents.
* Browser add-ons help to add paper references quickly.
* I did use Mendeley Reference Manager, which got slugish after some time and I had to shift to opensource Zotero, it works Great!
* I can see my pdfs in dark mode as well.
